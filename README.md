Do you even Die, bro? The Varied Die Roller Of Mythic Proportions

<p>Welcome to my dice roller. Both die rollers now work, including functionality to roll multiple dice and remove previous rolls. Recently added themes. Currently working on how rolls present themselves. In the future, there'll be different color options the dice. Also I would like to set it up to display the dice with the set sides instead of just a circle. In the far future there will be unicorns.</p>
