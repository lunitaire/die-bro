Do you even Die, bro? The Varied Die Roller Of Mythic Proportions

<p>Welcome. This is a work in progress. Both die rollers now work, including functionality to roll multiple dice and remove previous rolls. Recently added themes, including separate selection for just die. Currently working on how die rolls present themselves, inclduing displaying the dice with the set sides instead of just a circle. In the far future there will be unicorns.</p>
