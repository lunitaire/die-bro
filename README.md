Do you even Die, bro? The Varied Die Roller Of Mythic Proportions

<p>Do you even Die, bro? is a dice roller generator for role players. I started this personal project in 2015. It is built on Bootstrap with CSS and JavaScript. The die rolling functionality works, and at this point I am working on visuals to go with it. I also want to add a monster generator to it.</p>

#### Current planned changes for 2016 include:
* ~~Change Summon Unicorns to Monsters.~~
* Replace Unicorn placeholder image with Unicorn icon.
* Make other monster icons.
* Set monsters to roll HP and Initiative.
* Add about button that opens to explanation.
* Replace dice image placeholders with finals.
* Allow removal of specific monsters and die rolls.
* Pick a theme to stick with for now. 
* Move all other theme dev into separate branch.
